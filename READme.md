Project Proposal: 
Concept and Design of a Website with Selected Print Materials for a Fictional Cryptocurrency
At the onset of brainstorming for my final project, I aimed to craft something distinct from conventional topics. After deliberation, I settled on the idea of designing and programming a website. Among several potential themes, the concept of creating a fictional cryptocurrency intrigued me the most due to its uniqueness and relevance in today's landscape.

After presenting my ideas, feedback on the cryptocurrency concept was mixed, with concerns raised about the difficultz of its design and the challenge to fine the ballance between asthesic and paletable. However, these challenges fueled my determination to tackle the project with increased interest and ambition.

Consequently, I decided to proceed with the project, aiming to develop a compelling concept and design for the website and athe ssociated print materials.

In conclusion, the project theme was:

> "Conception and Design of a Website with Selected Print Materials: Logo, DIN A2 Poster, Business Card, and Stationery for a Fictional Cryptocurrency"
